The udp server and client codes in udp_server_client.js use udp datagram to deliver a single message from client to server.
The client code places the text message in a 'Buffer' and uses send() 
to send the message out to server. 

Q003: 
(1). Please determine the maximal size of a single text message the client is able to send to server. 
(2). How to send reliably a message larger than the maximal size determined in (1) from client to server?
